## About

This challenge was to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. The front-end was pre-built, my task was to use Express.js to link the back-end and deploy to Heroku. User story and acceptance criteria below:

### User Story

`AS A small business owner`

`I WANT to be able to write and save notes`

`SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete`

### Acceptance Criteria

`GIVEN a note-taking application`

`WHEN I open the Note Taker`

`THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page`

`WHEN I click on the link to the notes page`

`THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column`

`WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text`

`THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page`

`WHEN I click on the Save icon`

`THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes`

`WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column`

`THEN that note appears in the right-hand column`

`WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page`
