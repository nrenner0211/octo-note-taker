# octo-note-taker

## About

This challenge was to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. The front-end was already built, my task was to use Express.js to link the back-end and deploy to Heroku. User story below:

`AS A small business owner`
`I WANT to be able to write and save notes`
`SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete`
